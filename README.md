# Alicloud Vault
Alicloud Vault is a tool to securely store and access Alibaba Cloud credentials in a development environment.

Alicloud Vault stores RAM credentials in your operating system's secure keystore and then generates temporary credentials from those to expose to your shell and applications. It's designed to be complementary to the Aliyun CLI tools, and is aware of your config file and profiles in ~/.aliyun/config.

Full release and documentation will follow very soon.
